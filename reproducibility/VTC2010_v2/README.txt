Since the SL simulator has dramatically changed since the publication of the paper in 2010, the simulation scripts have been removed.
Many fixes and improvements have been done to the simulator, some of which did make the simulator perform differently. Thus, it was deemed more responsible to
1) remove the results from the release
2) provide equivalent (and more correct!) results, which is what you can now find in this folder.
